Bugs
====

* POP3: sometime downloaded emails are marked as read
	-> can not reproduce anymore
* POP3: sometime deleting a message does not delete it (it is re-fetched on next mail check)
	-> can not reproduce anymore
* [WONTFIX] POP3: downloaded emails have an extra "." at the end
	-> Thunderbird bug!

Improvements
============

* POP3: TOP command is incomplete (only TOP n 0 is supported)
* POP3: DELE, LIST, RETR, UIDL: rfc says argument may NOT refer to a message marked as deleted

New features
============

* re-work configuration, or at least externalize conf with a set of default built-in
	-> avoid to re-compile for a simple configuration change!
	-> pop3 server port in jar file name
	-> use Preferences?
* POP3: additional commands?
* POP3: allow to bind to a specific interface
* POP3: limit the number of simultaneous connections
* utility to list (IMAP) folders and their uid
* MBOX: mboxcl and mboxcl2 export
* MAILDIR: maildir++ export once we can fetch iNotes folders
* calendar (CalDAV)
* contacts (CardDAV)
* IMAP4rev1 (rfc 3501)
