Bugs
====

* [WONTFIX] POP3: downloaded emails have an extra "." at the end
	-> Thunderbird bug!
* POP3 user password is retained in memory for longer than necessary (we should drop it after auth)

Improvements
============

* POP3 configuration: mark as read/unread when message retrieved
* Log4J configuration to send errors by email
	-> remove LOGGER POP3 command as it is SLF4J-specific (or re-work to use reflexion)
* POP3: DELE, LIST, RETR, TOP, UIDL: rfc says argument may NOT refer to a message marked as deleted

New features
============

* POP3: use current client/user in NDC/MDC into logs
* POP3: allow to bind to a specific interface
* POP3: limit the number of simultaneous connections
* POP3: additional commands?
* MBOX: mboxcl and mboxcl2 export
* MAILDIR: maildir++ quota support?
* --calendar-- + todos + journal (CalDAV or ics + built-in http server)
* contacts (CardDAV)

Won't do
========

* POP3: rfc5034 (SASL); use POP3S instead
* POP3: rfc2595 (STARTTLS extension: STLS command); use POP3S instead
* mailbox: mbx: UW-IMAP's old (@Deprecated 2006) high performance mailbox format.
* maildir: mix: UW-IMAP's new (2006) high performance mailbox format.
* maildir: mailstore: exim's format
* maildir: cydir: Cyrus DB
* maildir: sdbox / mdbox: Dovecot


Not doable
==========

* calendar/meeting invites (ics in pop3/mbox/...): no UID information available
* IMAP4rev1 (rfc 3501): mismatch between some imap core commands and available webmail operations
