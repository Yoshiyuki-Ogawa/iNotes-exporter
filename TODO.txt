Bugs
====

* [WONTFIX] POP3: downloaded emails have an extra "." at the end
	-> Thunderbird bug!

Improvements
============

* POP3: TOP command is incomplete (only TOP n 0 is supported)
* POP3: DELE, LIST, RETR, UIDL: rfc says argument may NOT refer to a message marked as deleted

New features
============

* re-work configuration, or at least externalize conf with a set of default built-in
	-> avoid to re-compile for a simple configuration change!
	-> separate mbox properties from the rest
		-> extract webmail, username, passphrase, foldername into export.properties and move configuration reading from .inotes to .fs
	-> support pop3 server port in jar file name
	-> use Preferences? -> no!
	-> java -jar "eats" the classpath -> need to manually load an external, non-classpath, resource
	
	-> OR: put all configuration (iNotes, pop3) in a single file; may be easier for the user. And Pop3 extends iNotes.
* POP3: additional commands?
* POP3: allow to bind to a specific interface
* POP3: limit the number of simultaneous connections
* MBOX: mboxcl and mboxcl2 export
* MAILDIR: maildir++ export now that we can fetch iNotes folders
* calendar (CalDAV)
* contacts (CardDAV)
* IMAP4rev1 (rfc 3501)
